Discussion:
In traditional event management, scoring and judging often face several challenges. Organizers need an accurate count of judges and competitors to prepare score sheets and input competitor information correctly. However, this process is often inefficient, leading to poor judgment as judges focus more on writing comments and scores than observing the competition. The manual process of averaging and ranking scores is time-consuming and prone to errors.

Conclusions:
To address these issues, we propose Evalify, a web-based system that allows judges to input scores and comments directly. This system helps organizers manage score sheets, criteria, and add judges and competitors. By automating calculations and saving records of scores and comments, Evalify provides more efficient and accurate competition results.

Recommendations:
Evalify aims to streamline scoring processes, enhance security, automate tasks, and offer advanced analytics. This solution will:

Improve efficiency and accuracy in scoring.
Ensure secure handling of scoring data.
Automate repetitive tasks to reduce human error.
Provide valuable insights through advanced analytics.
Introduction
Managing event scoring traditionally is cumbersome and error-prone. Evalify is designed to simplify this process, allowing judges and organizers to input scores and comments in real-time. The system automates score calculations and rankings, ensuring accurate and timely results.

Problem Statement:
Traditional scoring methods are inefficient and lack transparency, leading to data input mistakes, calculation errors, and delays. The main issues are:

Inefficient Management: Manual processes are slow and error-prone.
Vulnerable Data: Lack of strong security measures risks data breaches.
Resource Tracking Bottlenecks: Real-time tracking and resolving disputes are challenging.
Lack of Analytics Tools: Limited insights into performance trends and event management.

Objective:
Evalify aims to modernize event scoring, enhance accessibility, and improve the user experience for judges, organizers, and competitors by:

Optimizing Scoring Processes: Making score entry and data management simpler and more efficient.
Enhancing Security Measures: Protecting data with robust security protocols.
Automating Tasks: Reducing human error and operational workload.
Providing Advanced Analytics: Offering insights into performance trends and event management.

Significance of the Study

Evalify will benefit:

Organizers: By increasing efficiency and accuracy in data handling.
Staffs: By providing a user-friendly interface for event management.
Judges: By automating score computation, allowing them to focus on judging.

Scope and Limitations
Scope:
Evalify will cover event management, scoring criteria setup, login credentials, participant and judge management, comments and feedback, and result printing.

Limitations:
The system does not address bias in judging and depends on the time consumed by participants, which can vary.

Requirement Gathering Techniques
Various techniques, such as user stories, will ensure the system meets the needs of all stakeholders. Examples include:

Event organizers can create custom score sheets and choose between ranking and averaging scores.
Judges can enter scores and comments easily and lock their scores once finalized.
Staff can monitor progress and print final results efficiently.

System Design

Evalify's design will include:

Functional Requirements: Event and participant management, scoring and judging, result management, and user management.
Non-Functional Requirements: Usability, security, and performance, ensuring the system is user-friendly, secure, and responsive.
